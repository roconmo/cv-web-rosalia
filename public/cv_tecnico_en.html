                        <p>
                            I am a Data & Cloud Engineer with experience in data environments and Cloud platforms
                            (GCP/Azure).
                            Throughout my career I have worked on technical projects collaborating closely with
                            engineering and business teams, participating in planning and task tracking
                            from a primarily technical role.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I feel comfortable translating technical language into clear decisions, bringing order,
                            structure
                            and context to facilitate teamwork. I am especially interested in how clarity in
                            execution and communication influences the ease and effectiveness of technology adoption.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to my technical profile, I design and develop landing pages and simple websites
                            for small businesses,
                            focused on clarity, structure and lead generation.
